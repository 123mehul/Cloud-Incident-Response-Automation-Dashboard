# ☁️ Cloud Incident Response Automation Dashboard

A modern dashboard that simulates **incident response automation** for cloud environments (e.g., AWS). Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**, the dashboard visualizes security alerts and automates EC2 isolation and threat mitigation.

## 🧠 Overview

This project showcases how a cloud security team can respond to incidents using automation. While front-end focused, it assumes backend functionality powered by AWS services like **CloudTrail**, **GuardDuty**, **Lambda**, and **Boto3** scripts.

The dashboard helps SOC analysts:
- View simulated alerts from cloud infrastructure
- Trigger automated isolation responses (conceptually)
- Analyze threat trends by severity and type
